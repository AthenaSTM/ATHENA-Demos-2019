# ATHENA-Demos-2019
Demos from the ATHENA project for 2019.

## RESTful API Demo
This directory contains the code for deploying a simple (demo-only) server that allows API access to some of the ATHENA classifiers. The server implements an RPC-style POST request allowing text to be submitted for classification (MLaaS; Machine Learning as a Service). It contains the server code with instructions for running it, and the pre-built classifiers (as Python pickles). Additional information is provided in the README files throughout the directory tree.

_This research was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF; USA) to Drs. J. Turner and A. Laird, grant number 1631325._
